                <h1>Visibility of system status</h1>
                <p>The application complies with this principle in which it displays the status of the devices while also letting the user know that their selected code for the different tasks is paired to the desired task and that it coincides with the code they inputted.</p>

                <h1>Match between system and the real world</h1>
                <p>It complies with this rule by utilizing the adequate vocabulary for the user while displaying a logical process through his interaction with the interface as seen primarily in the process to add a new Knocki device, calling the user’s attention through the plus sign in the down-right corner and being conducted by the app’s simple vocabulary while having simple processes. </p>

                <h1>User control and freedom</h1>
                <p>The app accomplishes to fulfill this by giving the user an exit out of things he or she doesn’t want through simple means like the gear that displays an option to delete a knocki device or a programmed activity or the back arrow when clicking an activity for not adding, in which the user can also use the cancel button, the arrow is displayed in other menus as well.</p>

                <h1>Consistency and standards</h1>
                <p>The different sections of the app comply with this heuristic by providing clarity to the user, most having different names that if chosen by the user they will give him or her a different outcome tied to the section’s name while also remaining visually distinct. This is also reinforced by the existence of the option wheel bound to the Knocki and activity objects in which the wheels display a menu with the similar function of modifying them giving some familiarization to the user.</p>

                <h1> Recognition rather than recall</h1>
                <p>The app complies by having most of it's options simply visible on the different sections and processes by having simple layouts and icons simplifying the user's cognitive processes fomenting simple recognition rather than the need to memorize the actions. The only options that may not be directly seen are the configuration options that are displayed when clicking the wheel on the Knocki and activity objects but they not seem to be much of a problem as this icon implies these configuration options. </p>

                <h1>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h1>
                <p> The app doesn't seem to comply specifically with this heuristic because of having only one process for adding knocki and adding activities. Although there exist instances of flexibility like on the knocki devices screen where the user can access the selected device's activities by clicking on the device icon or by clicking the wheel and selecting the option and also on the option of cancelling the adding of an activity by clicking either the back arrow or the cancel button.  It can be said that the knocki doesn't need to much flexibility as it's tasks are fairly simple but as an extra thing for more inexperienced users that have almost no interaction with technology by adding more explicit designations for certain areas.

                <h1>Aesthetic and minimalist design</h1>
                <p>The design of the app complies with this heuristic by having a simple layout and color scheme that doesn't require the user to put so much thought into the tasks and the interpretation of the interface helped by the minimum amount of text that conducts them through the processes.</p>
